### SOON ###
    add test for CTypeChain
        add also test that after exceptions thrown state is not changed

    check if global function variable declaration is covered by tests

### LATER ###
    check if inline return type of function pointer type is covered by tests if supported by C

    check if function pointer inside variable is covered by tests if supported by C
        struct foo { void (*bar)(int), ... }

    check if immediate struct variables are covered by test if supported by C
        struct {} foo, bar;
        check if it should declare the struct type at the same time
        check if can be combined with typedef
