### SOON ###
    consider adding support for blacklisted and whitelisted elements
        non-conforming elements will be skipped during parsing
        skip might be either until semicolon or curly bracket end is reached
        this will allow for partial library support for faster deliveries

### LATER ###
    check if array variable initializer covered by tests
    check if typedef of array of pointers to arrays is covered by tests if supported by C
    add vararg support for functions and function pointers
