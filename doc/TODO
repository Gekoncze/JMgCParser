### SOON ###
    finish to do in InlineTypeParsersTest

    check if order of arrays after parsing is correct
        int[1][2]
        should outer type be the one with 1 or 2 size?

    add test for CTypeChain
        add also test that after exceptions thrown state is not changed

    check if following is covered by type parser test
        struct {int a; int b;}*

    check if following is covered by variable parser test
        struct {int a; int b;}* foo[2];

    check if global function variable declaration is covered by tests

### LATER ###
    check if inline return type of function pointer type is covered by tests if supported by C

    check if function pointer inside variable is covered by tests if supported by C
        struct foo { void (*bar)(int), ... }

    check if immediate struct variables are covered by test if supported by C
        struct {} foo, bar;
        check if it should declare the struct type at the same time
        check if can be combined with typedef

    check if typedef of array of pointers to arrays is covered by tests if supported by C

    vararg support for functions and function pointers
